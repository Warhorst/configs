# configs
Personal configurations for different software I am using.

Current configurations:
- [helix](./helix): Contains the config.toml for the [helix editor](https://helix-editor.vercel.app/)
- [intellij](./intellij): Contains the ideavimrc configured for helix like motions with small adaptions by me. The original configuration is from [here](https://github.com/chtenb/helix.vim)
  - I activated macro support by reenabling the q binding
  - I set the line numbers to relative
  - I reenabled the system clipboard to be used, but this more or less made registers unusable
